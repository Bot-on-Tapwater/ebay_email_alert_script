# EBAY EMAIL ALERT SCRIPT

## DESCRIPTION
The script/application will assist anyone who has spent hours in ebay and other second hand market e-commerce sites looking for good deals on products. I personally run a business where I buy used electronics from USA and China, I proceed to test and clean up these items once they arrive and then resell them locally for a small profit. I spend countless hours on ebay looking for deals several times in a week, this script should ideally make this process easier for me. The script will search for a product on ebay, once the results for that product are back it will compare the listed price for the product against an ideal price that we would have set, a price we are willing to pay for that particular product, then the items that are priced equal to or under that ideal price will be sent to a specific email address in the form of a clickable link (in the title of the email we can include more identifiers of the specific prodcut whose link has been shared)
